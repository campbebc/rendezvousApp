rendezvous

There is too much ambiguity when creating plans using social media or text messages. Social media outlets, such as Facebook, do not facilitate immediate responses and allow for responders to mark maybe as an option. This makes it difficult for the creator to establish concrete plans for an event. On the other hand, when using texting to decide on plans, if a user does not wish to attend, they are still trapped in the flow of messages that no longer apply to them.

Our solution is to create an app that allows users to plan events that will have users respond immediately, while eliminating unnecessary information from reaching users who are not interested. This will be done by the event organizer sending out the details of the event via sms to the invited users with the options ‘attend’ and ‘don’t attend’. The results will be displayed back to the event organizer which allows them to make an educated decision on how to continue with the event.

Social Context

Rendezvous will be used to connect people with each other on a social level by providing a platform to confirm or deny your attendance at an event. By simply responding “yes” or “no,” the event planner and other attendees can know exactly how many people and which people will be attending.

Rendezvous will not be integrated with any other social media outlets such as twitter or facebook because it is meant to be a stand-alone product. Our application will solve the exact problem that text messaging and social media outlets have created: ambiguity. This will allow users to break free from the constraints of facebook and text messaging threads where people frequently “check in” to see if there has been any developments with the event (i.e. changed time, date, cancelled, etc.). Users will only have to respond once with “yes” or “no” and can receive one notification from the event planner if anything changes rather than scrolling through an endless feed of conversation and jabber. This minimalist approach will reduce the time users are “plugged-in” to social networking, down to a healthier level.
